# School Website Sample

--- 2020/09/08 ---

  The column class naming system has made it easy to build other pages quickly. I've been using the Lighthouse feature in Google Chrome to help improve the quality of the code too. Just working on building up other pages to get a complete site for now, with the next step being an animated news article page.

 My challenge with this website is to write everything from scratch with as few external libraries as possible. I've made a file called "responsive.css" which helps make a fully-adjustable responsive layout easy to create. This file relies on sets of div tags using the classes "row" and "col w-##".
  
  In this setup, the page is laid out in rows that span the full width of the screen, and the columns within each row are given a width (w) that is a percentage (##) of the total width. The important thing here is to make sure that the total widths are equal to 100%.
