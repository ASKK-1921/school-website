# School Website Sample

--- 2020/09/01 ---

 My challenge with this website is to write everything from scratch with as few external libraries as possible. I've made a file called "responsive.css" which helps make a fully-adjustable responsive layout easy to create. This file relies on sets of div tags using the classes "row" and "col w##".
  
  In this setup, the page is laid out in rows that span the full width of the screen, and the columns within each row are given a width (w) that is a percentage (##) of the total width. The important thing here is to make sure that the total widths are equal to 100%.
  
  My next challenge is to try and minimise the amount of coding required for this to work and try to implement it in other pages on the sample site.
